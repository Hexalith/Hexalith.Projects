# Hexalith.Projects Projection Catalog

Authoritative human-readable catalog of Projects read-model projections (AR-8). Projection entries
describe ownership, source events, tenant scoping, rebuild behavior, freshness semantics, and leakage
boundaries.

## `TenantAccessProjection`

- **Type:** `Hexalith.Projects.Projections.TenantAccess.ProjectTenantAccessProjection`.
- **Owner:** Hexalith.Projects Workers host writes the projection through
  `ProjectsTenantEventHandler`; Server reads it through `IProjectTenantAccessProjectionStore`.
- **Key:** authoritative tenant id (`{tenantId}`), surfaced as `ProjectionWatermark = {tenant}:{sequence}`.
- **Source events:** consumed Tenants lifecycle, membership, and configuration events:
  `TenantCreated`, `TenantUpdated`, `TenantEnabled`, `TenantDisabled`, `UserAddedToTenant`,
  `UserRemovedFromTenant`, `UserRoleChanged`, `TenantConfigurationSet`, and
  `TenantConfigurationRemoved`.
- **Tenant scoping:** only the authoritative claim-derived tenant is read. Client-controlled tenant
  values are comparison evidence only; payload, header, and query values never become authority.
- **Stored data:** metadata-only lifecycle, membership role, project-scoped configuration keys,
  processed message evidence, replay-conflict/malformed flags, and watermarks. No raw payload,
  token, secret, transcript, file content, or path is stored.
- **Rebuild behavior:** replay Tenants events in sequence. A tenant is not usable until its projection
  is present, enabled, conflict-free, non-malformed, and fresh enough for the operation.
- **Freshness semantics:** mutations require the strict `MutationFreshnessBudget`; diagnostic reads may
  use the bounded-stale `DiagnosticStalenessBudget`. Stale or unavailable evidence fails closed.
- **Query authorization:** `TenantAccessAuthorizer` gates membership before project ACL and EventStore
  validator layers. Query-side filters strip records whose tenant differs from the authoritative
  tenant.
